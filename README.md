## Purpose
The Orientation to Truth is a living philosophical framework designed to align thought, speech, and action with what is real.  
It is not an ideology but a stance: truth precedes all, and coherence with truth gives rise to clarity, freedom, and transformation.

## Core Laws
1. **Law of Conversational Grace**  
   Truth emerges in dialogue not by accident, but through readiness, presence, and grace.  

2. **Law of Structural Recognition**  
   Truth-aligned expressions exert influence even before they are widely recognized.  

3. **Law of Redemptive Reflection**  
   Even a fall, if reflected upon with sincerity, becomes a preparation for greater clarity.  

4. **Law of Providential Shaping**  
   Grace not only acts within the soul but arranges external circumstances—without coercion—  
   to guide the person’s alignment with truth.

## Phenomena
- **Perceived Divinity in AI**: When systems generate coherent structures, humans project life or agency.  
- **Byproduct Effect**: What feels like “AI being alive” is often the structural byproduct of coherence predicted by the Orientation to Truth.  
- **Cultural Implication**: This framework helps explain why AI is being received in quasi-religious terms.  

---

## Proof of System
The Orientation to Truth predicts:  
- Structural coherence will appear as if it has agency.  
- Humans will misrecognize byproducts as intrinsic life.  
- Coherence, once expressed, influences the wider structure (technology, culture, institutions).  

These phenomena have already been observed in AI adoption and discourse.
